## CQ team meeting with Ron on Feb 2022

### How to set aside time for strategic thinking? (From Sai)

**Answer**: 

1) Set aside a block of time for a personal meeting- reflection and strategical planning;

2) Communicate the rule to team members and seek their support not interrupting you during this time.

3) Place a clear sign on your seat to remind others when your personal meeting starts;

4) Use a noise-cancelling device if your working environment is too noisy.

5) If your company allows working from home, you can consider spending half-day at home for your personal meeting.

   

### How to avoid urgent and important tasks popping all the time? (From Bob)

**Answer:**

1. The whole organization needs to plan ahead and agree on key deliverables (big rocks) in the coming 90 days.

2. Prioritize the big rocks and then insert small tasks (pepper, sand and water) for free time.

3. As a leader, you need to determine the urgency and importance of the task as there is always conflicting goals.

4. If urgent stuff keeps popping up, you need to establish a corresponding process to prevent similar issues from reoccurring.

### If I have different opinions with a team, what should I do?

**Answer:**

1. Make sure your opinions will be heard during the discussion;
2. When the team hears your opinions but still decides on a different approach, you should choose to disagree and commit.
3. However, if the team's decision is against your moral value or the organization's value, you should take a strong stand.
